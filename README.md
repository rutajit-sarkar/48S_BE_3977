# SMART INFANT HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM WITH IOT-BASED FAILOVER MECHANISMS FOR RURAL AREAS


This project combines **AI-based infant monitoring** with **remote heart rate estimation** using computer vision. It uses infrared-compatible grayscale inputs and supports **real-time monitoring** through a suite of deep learning models deployed efficiently on both CPU and GPU environments.

## üß† Features

### üçº Infant Activity Monitoring
- **Baby Presence Detection** ‚Äì Detects presence or absence of baby.
- **Safe Sleep Detection** ‚Äì Identifies unsafe sleep conditions (e.g., prone position, occluded face).
- **Posture Estimation** ‚Äì Tracks baby posture using keypoint detection.
- **Emotion & Intrusion Detection** ‚Äì Classifies baby emotions and detects intrusions into crib/room.

**Models Used:**
- `YOLOv8` ‚Äì Baby detection, safe sleep classification, intrusion.
- `YOLOv11` ‚Äì Pose and emotion estimation (custom-trained).

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG)
- **Facial ROI Extraction** ‚Äì Automatically detects and tracks facial regions using YOLO.
- **Color Space Conversion** ‚Äì Converts RGB to YUV for improved pulse detection.
- **3D-CNN Architecture** ‚Äì Lightweight 3D-CNN for temporal signal analysis.
- **Real-Time HR Estimation** ‚Äì Estimates heart rate from face video in real time.
- **Grayscale/IR Image support** ‚Äì Support night time detection.

## üìÇ Dataset

- Combined and preprocessed multiple open-source datasets.
- Converted to **grayscale for infrared (IR) support** to enable night-time monitoring.
- Pose and emotion labels annotated and verified for infant suitability.
